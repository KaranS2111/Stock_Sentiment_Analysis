# Stock Sentiment Analysis

In this project, we will use stock price data of S&P500 from 2012 till the end of 2023 and news headlines from "New York Times" to build a model to predict stock prices. The additional news headlines will be used for sentiment analysis and then merged with the stock price dataset.

Training platform used - Google Colab
